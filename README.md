# ByteAntTest

My solution to test task given by ByteAnt


Task itself: 

Create an ASP.NET MVC application which returns HIERARCHICAL structure of employees and allows to search by employee name. 

There might be several hierarchy levels, i.e. CEO -> director -> manager -> employee

Front-end should be implemented on MVC (Razor + JQuery)
Back-end - MVC

Database should be filled with data by candidate
